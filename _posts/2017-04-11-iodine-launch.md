# Woohoo, welcome to Iodine!

This is my first post on the official Iodine website. As of right now, I am finishing up the first snapshot. Iodine 1.0.1 Alpha codename Genesis will use the Budgie desktop built by [Solus](http://solus-project.com/) which is very elegant. It will also use the LightDM GTK Greeter.

Yours truly,
Nicholas (Founder)

Also, we're based on Debian. I'm not that good at coding... yet.
