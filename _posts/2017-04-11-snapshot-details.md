# Woohoo!
Hello, Iodine fans or visitors. I'm excited to announce that Snapshot 1 works - and I'm just finishing it up and creating an install CD.
The first Snapshot will (obviously) contain Budgie Desktop and a few cool desktop wallpapers, and a few essential apps you might need.
We have not yet tested the OS on other systems, but you can! Until later releases, the Iodine OS will only support amd64 processor architectures.
This is because our Debian 9 core came on amd64 since our computers are amd64. Like I said, other architectures will be supported soon enough.

## Details
Iodine will use apt package manager, the package managing CLI tool used in Ubuntu and Debian. It will have Stretch repositories pre-loaded until we compile our own repos.
So, Debian immigrants will be used to Iodine, for now. Muaahahahahahaa. Just kidding. Other packages include LibreOffice and Discord.
